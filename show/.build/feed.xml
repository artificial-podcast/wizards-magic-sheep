      <itunes:summary><![CDATA["I see.

"But you don’t." Theo smiled, his red eyes flashing.

"I was only twelve. And I was the only one." Harry smiled.

"I like you," he said softly. He pulled his green eyes to his chest and smirked.

"I liked you, Theo." Theo pulled his hand back.

"Now that I have you all over again, I wanted to say something. It looked like the sun had just arrived for the day." Theo wrapped his other hand around Harry’s arm.

"You are beautiful, Harry." He said kissing his fingers.

"Hermione is beautiful, too next day they were going to a very special dinner for the seven and a half lions, but first they had to attend to the blood rituals. Harry was to take a lion, Hermione had to take a swine, and Theo had to take a chicken. Harry would ask what they were eating for the blood rituals, in the evening, the four of them would come back, and the lions would look at Harry and ask what he had eaten. The three of them would then begin the cutting. Harry would do the cutting and the chicken cut, then they would go out and buy a new dress for the feast, and Theo would wait for them. They would make their way to the dining room, and Theo would teach them what to do in the kitchen, so they could do their work in peace.

The next morning, Harry was able to finally get the letter. It was a message from the Head of the Department of Mysteries.

The Goblet of Fire was the only thing that could save a person from an impending death.

It was always Hermione's job to make sure everything was in place, but that didn't mean that everything was perfect.

The last thing Harry had planned was to send the letter to his godfather when someone got the chance, but he had to get the message to Harry himself.

He had had an idea that he couldn't keep his mouth shut.

He had a plan. plan that was perfect, but dangerous, but so-so. A plan that would keep the rest of the Resistance from hurting him.A plan that would make her happy.A plan that would make him a better father.A plan that would make him a better person.And a plan that would make him who Hermione wanted to be with.

Between the end of last night and the return of Draco and the peace of her soul, Hermione had decided that the time had come for her to return to the Malfoy Manor. She felt so alone. Like she was a prisoner in a dungeon that she didn't even know about.The Manor was her home, her home. And the moment she felt her eyes fill with tears, she shook her head, unable to give in.She’d imagined this past year as their home. And it was all connected, the house in flames and the flames in the air. The only thing that changed was the fact that Hermione had her own car, a car that she could drive. And it was an expensive one, the one that belonged to a man she didn’t know."You think that one will be your home?" Hermione whispered."Of course it will. I’ve been planning this house for years." Hermione nodded.

"It’s our home. And it’s the only home I allowed to keep as a residence of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black." Harry nodded his head.

"It’s safe, so the students have no reason to flee." Hermione said, pointing to the house where all the portraits resided.

"The only other place I know of that is my quarters here in the library, and I don’t want them moving in there." She shrugged.

"I’ll keep it that way." Harry nodded his agreement.

"What do you have to gain that way?" Draco asked, sounding unsure.

"Only gain that is worthy of us." Hermione said, knowing Harry’s answer. only thing that is worthy of us is the Queen’s Pleasure." Draco said in a low voice.

"That’s right. We’ll get it." Hermione said with a smile.

The Gryffindor girls rose from the couch and walked out of the dorms, leaving the Manor behind them. They turned around and walked out into the corridor.

"We couldn’t have done this without you." Pansy said as they walked forward and put their wands together.

"We wouldn’t have survived this without you." Blaise said.

"P Draco said angrily.

Merlin, you're stupider than we thought if you think so." 

 Both Bellatrix and her men exchanged looks of shock. 

 "Alright, fine," Harry grinned. 

 "We’ll see what we’ve been missing." 

 The boys left the Great Hall together and Hermione followed them. 

 Hermione was slightly surprised when she saw Kingsley standing beside Harry and Ron. They were holding a sign that said 

 "I know," Ron grinned. 

 "I know," Harry smiled. 

 "Well done, mate." Ron grinned back.

"I’ll be here soon." 

 Harry didn’t look up and didn’t say anything Harry smirked back.

"Dumbledore said I’ll have control of the school, and I’ll be the perfect spy to get information at the school." He continued.

"I’ll be able to hide it well enough that nobody can see it. No one will know."

"I’ll be the perfect spy." Harry nodded.

"I swear to Merlin, I’ll be able to hide everything well enough that nobody can see it. No one can know."

"I’ll be able to hide it a little better than the last time, but I’ll be able to hide it."

"Don’t be stupid," Hermione said, looking at him with a change of tone.

"Just, don’t be too dedicated. You’ll see how much I like it when I get the chance."

"I’ll be fine," he said, looking at her.

"I’m just not ready to go out there for a little bit of fun. It’s not like I’m any good with sneaking around."Hermione looked at him, watching him put his hand up. He was wearing a few loose, pale pink knickers that made him look like a poodle. None of them looked like he would ever be careless, as far as I know."

"I asked around, but didn’t find anything I’d like to use to restrain him," Henry said sullenly.

"What do you think about using a Floo connection?"Hermione looked at the twins, all of whom were laughing and grinning as they went after Justin."I’m not into talking about the pompous twins," Justin said, leaning forward and burying his face into his hands."It’s not like I’m biased," Hermione said, grinning.

"I just prefer people who look down their noses at you." been with you two my dear," she said, and the three of them found themselves in a duel between them, but somehow it looked like they were even willing to fight. After all, they were all on the same side. Hermione was shoving Draco, and Draco’s body shook as she pushed him away. It seemed like the two of them were ready for a fight and in that moment, they found a way to get out of it, and they were about to get revenge."No, you’re right," Harry said.

"I think I’ve finally figured out why you two have been fighting."

"That’s not why I’m here," Hermione said, shaking her head.

"You know who else is here?"Her eyes darted around the room and Hermione could see a hand on her shoulder."You know who else?" she asked.

"You’re not just a prisoner. You’ve got a brotherhood of your own." Hermione placed her hands on the floor and Hermione was surprised by the gesture.

"You’re the one who’ve been trapped inside this room."Hermione gasped, when she saw that she was talking nonsense.

"You said you’ve been trapped in this room?" she demanded." Room of Requirement," he said.

"I didn’t want to have to see you locked in here."Hermione’s eyes were wide with terror.

"Uh, yes. How do you know I was in this room, then?"

"I’m the one who found you in the cubicle," he said.

"I was looking for you when I found you in the fifth floor corridor."She grimaced.

"I’m sorry, I’m sorry... "She felt her hands shaking as they raced from her outstretched hands. She felt the room start to spin and fill with air, but she was too late. The corridor was filled with panicked voices. Did we really have to hear that?They suddenly backed away, lifeless bodies flying. Let's not get caught here."Bella, it's time!" The voice boomed as the two women started to chase each other with their hands. Bella, it's time!"It's time!" The voice said with a grimace. This is a battle, we don't have time to be out here!"What is it? Why is it so quiet?" The voice asked. We have to go, it's early..."You can't tell Ba]]></itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[
Hermione felt her mind slipping away from her thoughts. The thought of Draco watching her again gave her the courage she needed to continue. The fact that he was so close to her in his arms and still in the same place gave her the strength she hadn't felt in a while. She could only hope that if he was able to see her again that he would be able to see her as a person. He was Hermione's friend and a promise that she had made to him. She couldn't let that affect her the way the world had.The last thing she wanted to do was make a scene. If it was the end of the year, she would never be able to come out of the shadows. She needed to get out of the house. Maybe she could even sneak out of it. He was right. She would be safe. She would be good to go back to the man she'd been cursed to share in his misery. 

 Ashley sighed in relief when she placed her hand on the tip of Tom's wand. It was a simple incantation that she knew would do the trick. She was able to conjure an empty room with an old bathroom. The door was locked and she could sneak in if she wanted to. She was in no rush to leave the home. No matter how far her wand traveled, she would never be able to reach the backdoor. Only a day or two she would be able to get inside. Tom would have to make sure she was there before he interrogated her. Unfortunately the Cruciatus Curse had its own set of reactions, and Hermione was well aware. She didn't have a lot of time to get her wand out of her waistband. Though she was in the middle of the room, she wasn't paranoid enough to risk it. She had more time than that. The lecture was in order.Hermione was in no position to help her. The tension was already growing. The tension was growing and the edges of the wards were starting to crumble. The situation was becoming so dire that it was difficult to watch. She had to be calm about the unknown. She was afraid to be left in the dark. She didn't know how to tell the wizard what to do. When the curse came to him, he was shocked; he had never seen a man so reckless and violent as to fall into such misery. The curses were multiplied and multiplied until they were like the sun, shining brightly and becoming a constant in all of Wizarding Britain. He watched the man, who had been lying on the floor, turn pale and pale and pale until his eyes grew dry and he had to stop. He watched the man's limp body descend into a series of blue and green flames. He watched the man's eyes, which were now more of a dark brown, turn dark gray, and he put his head on the side of the stool. He watched the man's eyes, which had been turned dark gray, turn bright, bright green. When the light from the fireplace faded, a small silver button fell off the side of the car and slid off the outside of it, revealing the place where the bomb would be located. Of course there would be no bombs in this village, and it was likely they would have some, perhaps even a few, already planted. No wonder the Dursleys knew this place was their hideout even if they knew nothing about it. It was an obvious mistake to leave the bombs here, not to mention how many of them they left behind, they didn't have the weapons. The Order would find something, and they would find a way to get it. 

 The sun was out the window, illuminating the village, and it took all of two minutes to find Harry's hiding place, over a kilometer from the village. 

 "Amelia, where are you?" Harry cried, startled. 

 "I’m in the kitchen," Amelia said, looking up.

"I can help you." 

 "Yes," Harry nodded. 

 "Well, I’m supposed to help you and Ron," Amelia said gently.

"But where are you?" 

 "I’m not sure," Harry said. 

 "I’m sorry, but it’s too dangerous," Amelia said soothingly. @ "Let’s get out of here now and get out of here!"

"But you’re in my house, right?" Amelia asked skeptically.

"I’ve been woken up in the middle of the night." She shook her head.

"You don’t have to do that."

"You don’t have to do that?" Amelia arched an eyebrow.

"But I didn’t g]]></itunes:summary>

Hermione stood in the middle of the street, staring at the men in the crowd. The young woman had some sort of petulant charm on her that had her going off to wherever she could find something to do, nothing more. The young woman was as if she were seeing the light, and it was a sight she could never forget. 

 The young woman stopped, drew a circle from her wand, and muttered to herself that she was done with her studies and she could find someplace to be. She was finally able to find a place to take her place, though she still felt a bit of a shame over her past, because she even had a past to deal with. She was finally going to be able to be herself again, and at least she was in the past. 

 Draco was lying on Granger's bed, with a damp blanket on the bedside table. The mattress and the sleeping bag on the floor were covered in blankets that Hermione was shaking off, and the only thing holding her in place was her chest."I can't believe you're planning this. I can't believe that you realize he's hurting her!"

"C'mon, Hermione, you've got no fucking clue about this," Ron mumbled as he and Harry were all alone."I can't believe you're planning this on me," Harry said as he took a seat at Hermione's bedside."How do you know you're planning this?" Ron asked as he sat up and moved over to sit at the other end of the table, so that he could be heard over the silence of the room. 

 "We need to talk about the Death Eaters." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Well, they were a bunch of fools. They didn’t know who they were until a year ago." 

 "What?" 

 "It was a great group of people. They were all very good looking and I'd say that was the most attractive part." 

 "The best part was that it was a lot more fun, and I didn't have to do all the work. I had a good group of friends before, and the girls were all pretty and nice. I was happy with the girls, and I'd like to think that I could be a part of that group again. I'm not a fan of the guys, and I didn't have many sex partners at the time I just spent a lot of time with all of them and had a lot of time alone, and soon I was going to be in a lot of trouble."

"You're right. We're still talking about it but I think we need to talk about this."

"Yes."

"I think it's time to move on. None of us have had sex before, so we have a lot of room to explore."

"I'm not sure what we're talking about, but something tells me that we're just trying to keep people together so that they're both safe. I'm not sure it's a good thing for the rest of us to be so hoodwinked, but it's a good thing that Draco Malfoy is still alive and alive. I'm glad that he's alive, it's nice to see him alive."

"I think Ron's got to be a part of this all right?"

"Yeah, thank you for that, Harry."

"I'm glad, Harry.

I know I didn't mean to. But I'm not actually sure what the fuck it is about her, and I don't want to watch her get tortured by a man of her age in front of me." She went with a smile.

"I was thinking that maybe with you in these masks that I would not be the only one who has been tortured, but I'm not sure how that's even possible." I hated that she was correct about that. Nobody is entirely safe if they are blind. She shrugged it off.

"I do believe that with a bit of proper training I would be able to train a bit more men to be able to see me. Maybe that would give me more control over them."I gave her a look that said I was sorry, but I was not. I was angry and needed to be better than this. I would not allow her to be hurt and I wasn't going to give up on her. I felt my magic crackling around me as the Floo went up, and I saw that the wizards were standing."What are you doing here?"

"What do we do with Hermione?"

"How do you know we have her in the house?"

"She's our wife."I opened my mouth and nodded, but I didn't have to think about it.

"We can talk, just like I do." I wanted to make my mental walls snap and I knew I couldn't.

"But we also have to be careful about their reactions. As much as she may be a little cruel about this one, I just can't imagine one of them having any qualms. It's just... it's not like they're all evil and all looking for a bit of revenge."

"That's... you think they're all evil?"

"No, they're all trying to put their own stamp on the world and make it more prejudiced?"Hermione nodded.

"Well, I'm not judging by any of their expressions, or their behavior, but they have to be careful. If they think they have the right to be here, they have to be even more careful."She couldn't go through with this. Not yet. What if they took a wrong turn and she was right? Could they come out of it with a vengeance?The second part of the plan worked perfectly. She wasn't sure how long she'd been waiting to go down on the last turn, but it was the perfect moment to come up with a new plan. She could be completely honest about everything that she knew. Pushing aside the depressing thoughts that perhaps she never really was what she thought she was, Hermione's instincts kicked in. Was she really ready to trust a wizard that horrible or would she trust her own eyes only in the dark? She was tempted to believe that she knew all of the secrets of her past, but that was only for a very short period of time. Each time she put her survival above all else, she would not hesitate to use her to her advantage. It was possible to survive a war that was a bloody, bloody mess. The Resistance had been brutal for years. All of the Resistance knew that. Yet, it was the knowledge that they were all in trouble.Draco could not help but joke to himself. He would take his little mistress and move to the war-zone. She didn't have to worry about a future with them. After all, they were both adults and had been through a lot. She was his for the first time. It was not like she was going to back down. She'd already given in to her husband's desires. She would never tell him anything that would make her feel any less than he already did. For all she knew, he had been working as a tracker himself since he was almost seven. She knew that he had been trying to track down and kill those who had been caught in the last war. Not only had they all been high-profile fugitives, but Fenrir had been so close to being a Death Eater once that he had been so close to becoming one himself. The Dark Lord knew that she was an asset to the regime. He would have no problem in finding her and finding the rest of the Resistance. It would be the S.S. as it was known. She would not allow herself to even think about the possibility that he was working for the Resistance. Protection for their family would be second to none.Hermione knew that he had some information that was important to her. He was a spy, one who had connections that she didn't give a damn a]]></itunes:summary>

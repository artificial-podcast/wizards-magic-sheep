Hermione stood in the middle of the street, staring at the men in the crowd. The young woman had some sort of petulant charm on her that had her going off to wherever she could find something to do, nothing more. The young woman was as if she were seeing the light, and it was a sight she could never forget. 

 The young woman stopped, drew a circle from her wand, and muttered to herself that she was done with her studies and she could find someplace to be. She was finally able to find a place to take her place, though she still felt a bit of a shame over her past, because she even had a past to deal with. She was finally going to be able to be herself again, and at least she was in the past. 

 Draco was lying on Granger's bed, with a damp blanket on the bedside table. The mattress and the sleeping bag on the floor were covered in blankets that Hermione was shaking off, and the only thing holding her in place was her chest."I can't believe you're planning this. I can't believe that you realize he's hurting her!"

"C'mon, Hermione, you've got no fucking clue about this," Ron mumbled as he and Harry were all alone."I can't believe you're planning this on me," Harry said as he took a seat at Hermione's bedside."How do you know you're planning this?" Ron asked as he sat up and moved over to sit at the other end of the table, so that he could be heard over the silence of the room. 

 "We need to talk about the Death Eaters." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Well, they were a bunch of fools. They didnâ€™t know who they were until a year ago." 

 "What?" 

 "It was a great group of people. They were all very good looking and I'd say that was the most attractive part." 

 "The best part was that it was a lot more fun, and I didn't have to do all the work. I had a good group of friends before, and the girls were all pretty and nice. I was happy with the girls, and I'd like to think that I could be a part of that group again. I'm not a fan of the guys, and I didn't have many sex partners at the time I just spent a lot of time with all of them and had a lot of time alone, and soon I was going to be in a lot of trouble."

"You're right. We're still talking about it but I think we need to talk about this."

"Yes."

"I think it's time to move on. None of us have had sex before, so we have a lot of room to explore."

"I'm not sure what we're talking about, but something tells me that we're just trying to keep people together so that they're both safe. I'm not sure it's a good thing for the rest of us to be so hoodwinked, but it's a good thing that Draco Malfoy is still alive and alive. I'm glad that he's alive, it's nice to see him alive."

"I think Ron's got to be a part of this all right?"

"Yeah, thank you for that, Harry."

"I'm glad, Harry.

I know I didn't mean to. But I'm not actually sure what the fuck it is about her, and I don't want to watch her get tortured by a man of her age in front of me." She went with a smile.

"I was thinking that maybe with you in these masks that I would not be the only one who has been tortured, but I'm not sure how that's even possible." I hated that she was correct about that. Nobody is entirely safe if they are blind. She shrugged it off.

"I do believe that with a bit of proper training I would be able to train a bit more men to be able to see me. Maybe that would give me more control over them."I gave her a look that said I was sorry, but I was not. I was angry and needed to be better than this. I would not allow her to be hurt and I wasn't going to give up on her. I felt my magic crackling around me as the Floo went up, and I saw that the wizards were standing."What are you doing here?"

"What do we do with Hermione?"

"How do you know we have her in the house?"

"She's our wife."I opened my mouth and nodded, but I didn't have to think about it.

"We can talk, just like I do." I wanted to make my mental walls snap and I knew I couldn't.

"But we also have to be careful about their reactions. As much as she may be a little cruel about this one, I just can't imagine one of them having any qualms. It's just... it's not like they're all evil and all looking for a bit of revenge."

"That's... you think they're all evil?"

"No, they're all trying to put their own stamp on the world and make it more prejudiced?"Hermione nodded.

"Well, I'm not judging by any of their expressions, or their behavior, but they have to be careful. If they think they have the right to be here, they have to be even more careful."She couldn't go through with this. Not yet. What if they took a wrong turn and she was right? Could they come out of it with a vengeance?The second part of the plan worked perfectly. She wasn't sure how long she'd been waiting to go down on the last turn, but it was the perfect moment to come up with a new plan. She could be completely honest about everything that she knew. Pushing aside the depressing thoughts that perhaps she never really was what she thought she was, Hermione's instincts kicked in. Was she really ready to trust a wizard that horrible or would she trust her own eyes only in the dark? She was tempted to believe that she knew all of the secrets of her past, but that was only for a very short period of time. Each time she put her survival above all else, she would not hesitate to use her to her advantage. It was possible to survive a war that was a bloody, bloody mess. The Resistance had been brutal for years. All of the Resistance knew that. Yet, it was the knowledge that they were all in trouble.Draco could not help but joke to himself. He would take his little mistress and move to the war-zone. She didn't have to worry about a future with them. After all, they were both adults and had been through a lot. She was his for the first time. It was not like she was going to back down. She'd already given in to her husband's desires. She would never tell him anything that would make her feel any less than he already did. For all she knew, he had been working as a tracker himself since he was almost seven. She knew that he had been trying to track down and kill those who had been caught in the last war. Not only had they all been high-profile fugitives, but Fenrir had been so close to being a Death Eater once that he had been so close to becoming one himself. The Dark Lord knew that she was an asset to the regime. He would have no problem in finding her and finding the rest of the Resistance. It would be the S.S. as it was known. She would not allow herself to even think about the possibility that he was working for the Resistance. Protection for their family would be second to none.Hermione knew that he had some information that was important to her. He was a spy, one who had connections that she didn't give a damn a]]></itunes:summary>

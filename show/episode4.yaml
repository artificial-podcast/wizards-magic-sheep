    He could hear herself crying against his chest now. It had been hard since they started fighting earlier. But then, knowing just who would be ableÂ to find him after all this time, and also knowing about Hermione, he knew their bond would never end well. The first thing he did before leaving Hogwarts was to get dressed ready for bed, but soon enough, Ron noticed something else was wrong.

    "What are you doing?" Ron asked hesitantly not moving one bit between his hands or feet despite the fact Harry was glaring down at him.

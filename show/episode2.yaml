  episodeText: "\nHermione stood in the middle of the street, staring at the men in the crowd. The young woman had some sort of petulant charm on her that had her going off to wherever she could find something to do, nothing more. The young woman was as if she were seeing the light, and it was a sight she could never forget. \n\n The young woman stopped, drew a circle from her wand, and muttered to herself that she was done with her studies and she could find someplace to be. She was finally able to find a place to take her place, though she still felt a bit of a shame over her past, because she even had a past to deal with. She was finally going to be able to be herself again, and at least she was in the past. \n\n Draco was lying on Granger's bed, with a damp blanket on the bedside table. The mattress and the sleeping bag on the floor were covered in blankets that Hermione was shaking off, and the only thing holding her in place was her chest.\"I can't believe you're planning this. I can't believe that you realize he's hurting her!\"\n\n\"C'mon, Hermione, you've got no fucking clue about this,\" Ron mumbled as he and Harry were all alone.\"I can't believe you're planning this on me,\" Harry said as he took a seat at Hermione's bedside.\"How do you know you're planning this?\" Ron asked as he sat up and moved over to sit at the other end of the table, so that he could be heard over the silence of the room. \n\n \"We need to talk about the Death Eaters.\" \n\n \"What do you mean?\" \n\n \"Well, they were a bunch of fools. They didnâ€™t know who they were until a year ago.\" \n\n \"What?\" \n\n \"It was a great group of people. They were all very good looking and I'd say that was the most attractive part.\" \n\n \"The best part was that it was a lot more fun, and I didn't have to do all the work. I had a good group of friends before, and the girls were all pretty and nice. I was happy with the girls, and I'd like to think that I could be a part of that group again. I'm not a fan of the guys, and I didn't have many sex partners at the time I just spent a lot of time with all of them and had a lot of time alone, and soon I was going to be in a lot of trouble.\"\n\n\"You're right. We're still talking about it but I think we need to talk about this.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I think it's time to move on. None of us have had sex before, so we have a lot of room to explore.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure what we're talking about, but something tells me that we're just trying to keep people together so that they're both safe. I'm not sure it's a good thing for the rest of us to be so hoodwinked, but it's a good thing that Draco Malfoy is still alive and alive. I'm glad that he's alive, it's nice to see him alive.\"\n\n\"I think Ron's got to be a part of this all right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, thank you for that, Harry.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, Harry.\n"

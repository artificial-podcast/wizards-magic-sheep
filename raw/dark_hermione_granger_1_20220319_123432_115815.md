Merlin, you're stupider than we thought if you think so." 

 Both Bellatrix and her men exchanged looks of shock. 

 "Alright, fine," Harry grinned. 

 "We’ll see what we’ve been missing." 

 The boys left the Great Hall together and Hermione followed them. 

 Hermione was slightly surprised when she saw Kingsley standing beside Harry and Ron. They were holding a sign that said 

 "I know," Ron grinned. 

 "I know," Harry smiled. 

 "Well done, mate." Ron grinned back.

"I’ll be here soon." 

 Harry didn’t look up and didn’t say anything Harry smirked back.

"Dumbledore said I’ll have control of the school, and I’ll be the perfect spy to get information at the school." He continued.

"I’ll be able to hide it well enough that nobody can see it. No one will know."

"I’ll be the perfect spy." Harry nodded.

"I swear to Merlin, I’ll be able to hide everything well enough that nobody can see it. No one can know."

"I’ll be able to hide it a little better than the last time, but I’ll be able to hide it."

"Don’t be stupid," Hermione said, looking at him with a change of tone.

"Just, don’t be too dedicated. You’ll see how much I like it when I get the chance."

"I’ll be fine," he said, looking at her.

"I’m just not ready to go out there for a little bit of fun. It’s not like I’m any good with sneaking around."Hermione looked at him, watching him put his hand up. He was wearing a few loose, pale pink knickers that made him look like a poodle. None of them looked like he would ever be careless, as far as I know."

"I asked around, but didn’t find anything I’d like to use to restrain him," Henry said sullenly.

"What do you think about using a Floo connection?"Hermione looked at the twins, all of whom were laughing and grinning as they went after Justin."I’m not into talking about the pompous twins," Justin said, leaning forward and burying his face into his hands."It’s not like I’m biased," Hermione said, grinning.

"I just prefer people who look down their noses at you." been with you two my dear," she said, and the three of them found themselves in a duel between them, but somehow it looked like they were even willing to fight. After all, they were all on the same side. Hermione was shoving Draco, and Draco’s body shook as she pushed him away. It seemed like the two of them were ready for a fight and in that moment, they found a way to get out of it, and they were about to get revenge."No, you’re right," Harry said.

"I think I’ve finally figured out why you two have been fighting."

"That’s not why I’m here," Hermione said, shaking her head.

"You know who else is here?"Her eyes darted around the room and Hermione could see a hand on her shoulder."You know who else?" she asked.

"You’re not just a prisoner. You’ve got a brotherhood of your own." Hermione placed her hands on the floor and Hermione was surprised by the gesture.

"You’re the one who’ve been trapped inside this room."Hermione gasped, when she saw that she was talking nonsense.

"You said you’ve been trapped in this room?" she demanded." Room of Requirement," he said.

"I didn’t want to have to see you locked in here."Hermione’s eyes were wide with terror.

"Uh, yes. How do you know I was in this room, then?"

"I’m the one who found you in the cubicle," he said.

"I was looking for you when I found you in the fifth floor corridor."She grimaced.

"I’m sorry, I’m sorry... "She felt her hands shaking as they raced from her outstretched hands. She felt the room start to spin and fill with air, but she was too late. The corridor was filled with panicked voices. Did we really have to hear that?They suddenly backed away, lifeless bodies flying. Let's not get caught here."Bella, it's time!" The voice boomed as the two women started to chase each other with their hands. Bella, it's time!"It's time!" The voice said with a grimace. This is a battle, we don't have time to be out here!"What is it? Why is it so quiet?" The voice asked. We have to go, it's early..."You can't tell Bambi that the dungeons are empty..." The voice said, and now the two women were laughing at a tale of fut The two women were known to laugh at each other but not when it came to the other."What did you do to Hermione?"

"She was going to a certain location just for a mystery event. You didn't want to have any guests in there."

"No, no, that's not what I was talking about. I know who was responsible for that. I'll tell you later, but for now, let's just enjoy the fun."Ashley giggled at the idea of Gryffindor sneaking around like a true Slytherin.

"No, I won't. You're the only one that knows. I have to tell you, I am the only one who is privy to this."

"Well, it's not as if you're the only one that has to answer to her."It was true. She didn't want to be the only person who knew. Hermione had some secrets that she didn't want to share. Her past with Augustus and Augustus' public fallings was nothing compared to the pain of her secrets with Antonin. Not even Augustus could blame her. She'd already suffered enough. Had she always been this way? Had her past always been more important than what happened to her?"Yes, well, I'm not sure. I feel like I've always been this way. There's a lot about me that I've always been hiding."She was embarrassed by her admission. Hermione knew she was right. Augustus was perfecting his mask of surprise. She would have to do that again soon, but for the time being, she would. With a smile, he offered her a small smile, and she accepted. 

 "Astoria, it's time for my game. I'm ready." 

 He reached across the table to gently place a kiss on her forehead. Hermione could only stare at him in silence for a few seconds. The slight tingling on her forehead, the slight ache, the slight burning, the slight prickling, the slight tremors in her arms, the very brief moment it all began. Augustus smiled softly and picked up his cane."Come here." He placed the small old book on the table, wand in hand.

"This is terrible, I can't believe I should call you a 'saviour'." She barely said the name.

"But you're a 'saviour, eh? I've always pratted you on the things you can't control. I don't want you to be frightened anymore."

"I know, how can I be a saviour if I never said anything to you?" He laughed.

"And I can't control you. I've seen you struggle with the Dark Magic of the Elder Wand, you're a little different from everyone else."

"Nobody else in their right mind would call you that, I'm just a saviour!" She said, before even managing to put the words right.

"I use magic to protect my family. I would never let anyone else harm them. I am not a child. I am merely a human being. I am not a mudblood. I do not come with blood. I do not have a god".Hermione glared.

"Draco! You think you can just call me mudblood? I’m a pureblood!" She spat angrily.

"You think you can call me Mudblood for a reason!"

"You think I’m a mudblood for money. I’ll pay you for my blood. I’m not rich! You pay me, you’re a slave!" Draco said angrily, his anger growing. Hermione raised an eyebrow and glared him right in his face. She was the reason why he was so scared of dark hair and his tendency to use spells. For some reason, the way she always looked made him think of her as a child. Hermione didn't like the way he looked. It was dark and...  she didn't like the way he looked after his little ones.He wasn't a child, so she pretended to be one. She stared at the floor in front of her, trying to process the information. She was too old for this world, so she was making a fool of herself, ignoring the danger in her eyes. She couldn't hold back from staring. If she looks at him, she'll just be staring at herself. She was able to look at him through a mirror, but it wasn't until he closed the mirror and found his true self that Draco was staring with glee.

"I think it's gonna be fun to see you all fail at that." He winked at Daphne, who laughed.

"You're good, Daph. You'll be great." He smirked at his best friend.

"Now, I think we can get back to the other plans. You're going to be good at poker this evening." He smirked at Lily, who was sitting next to the twins.

"I wonder if I can use that against you." He smirked as he pulled out a small bag of Galleons.

"You're going to do all this for me." He smirked as he handed it to her.

"You have to know that it was a lie, isn't it? You and Draco are the most complete people I've ever met. You say so yourself, but I have never seen you this way." He smirked as he pulled out the letter and opened it.

"It is the full contents of the diary."

"Thank you," she said at first looking for anything on the school but found nothing. A large volume had been turned over to her and she looked it over before speaking.

"I have a letter from you, it is the only thing that I can give you."Hermione had been reading for some time now and she could tell that this was the most important thing since the beginning. But then she remembered something. Something that had her worried. She had to be prepared to act. It was an old feeling. If she could act, she could save people. She could save herself. If she was even capable of that, she would do it alone. 

 She was preparing herself for the day when the sun began to shine through the windows. 

 "Hermione?" 

 "What are you doing here?" 

 "You do not eat, I promise." 

 "You must be hungry." 

 "You must be hungry." 

 She opened her mouth to speak, but it was a futile attempt. The sound of food falling to the ground did not rise up. It grew louder and louder until it reached a high pitch and erupted into a breath-taking hurtful crack. It was so loud that even Hydrus was surprised it had never been heard. 

 "Pleasure," Hermione murmured through her piercing blue eyes.

"This is the best night of your life, Hermione. You have a plan." 

 "What?" Hydrus asked, confused. 

 "I don't have a plan," Hermione said with a sly grin, lifting her arm and letting her arms fall to her sides.

"I only planned on fucking die this morning. If I die today, I'll be the one that dies." 

 "I'm not dying," the mer in the kitchen scoffed, gesturing for both Hermione and herself to leave.

"No, it's already been suggested that you and Draco could stay here. It's not like you would be able to save us."

"I...  I didn't want to," Hermione admitted, slowly moving toward the bathroom. She was too old for the same and was too sensitive to the stress of the world around her.

"I knew you wanted to come to me, and I told you to stay here and not come back. I couldn't have you and I’m not ready for you, so I went ahead and stayed here. Draco...  I don’t know what happened. I’m not ready for you either, but...  I love you and I feel so connected with you. I’ been looking forward to this for months, okay?" Draco smiled before kissing her.

"What do you want?" 

 Hermione felt a rush of magic as soon as she touched Draco’s hand. She felt as though it was boiling inside of her. She felt like she was floating through a giant bubble, surrounded by everything that she wanted. It was hot, so she bit into Draco’s hand as he wrapped his arm around her shoulders. The sudden rush of magic was like drowning her in a toxic pool. Hermione felt like she was floating in a giant wave. She felt like she was floating in a giant spider web. She’d never felt anything like that before.The yellowish material wrapped around the spider and her tongue swam into it. It felt like water, like heavy, viscous material. It was beautiful. A gift. It was the only thing she felt alive after so many years in the dark. It was a gift. It was her. She was the only one who felt them. They were there for her. The last thing she felt was the weight of the thing on her hands.She was trying to keep her eyes and ears closed, but she couldn’t fail in a sexual manner. She got a good look at Draco’s mouth. She couldn’t help but imagine what he’d have to say about her tonight."Did you really think that I would just go and cross my fingers to stop you?" Lavender shrieked, her eyes wide and pale."Oh, I know. You’re the worst person in the world." Dumbledore sneered.Theo let out a groan of pain as he watched the scene in front of him.

"She lied, she was a little on the sensitive side," he said.

"Oh, you really don’t like her."

"She’s the witch who did it," Lavender whispered desperately.

"If only I could help her." Dumbledore looked at his sister.

"But I doubt it. I know that’ the reason you’ve been cleared." 

 "I’ve been told that before, yes." 

 "Yes, you’re the only one with any memory of what happened that night in Hogwarts." 

 "And we know it was you, too, in the library." 

 The teenager’s eyes widened to the size of saucers. 

 "Who told you that?" Dumbledore asked gleefully. 

 "My father, Reginald, and my mother, Eira," Hermione explained, her eyes narrowing in fear. 

 "As you wish. But I didn’t think that would stop you from taking me in. You are my brother’s best friend, I’m so sorry I couldn’t take you with me. I’m so sorry I couldn’t take you with me. Please." 

 Before he could say anything more, Dumbledore let go of his wand and raised his wand at the floo connection.

"I’m sorry I couldn’t take you with me. You are my best friend. Please." He turned his eyes to the Wizarding World.

"I’m so sorry I couldn’t take you with me. I’m so sorry I couldn’t.

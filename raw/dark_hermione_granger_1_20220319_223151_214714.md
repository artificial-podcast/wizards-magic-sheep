I know I didn't mean to. But I'm not actually sure what the fuck it is about her, and I don't want to watch her get tortured by a man of her age in front of me." She went with a smile.

"I was thinking that maybe with you in these masks that I would not be the only one who has been tortured, but I'm not sure how that's even possible." I hated that she was correct about that. Nobody is entirely safe if they are blind. She shrugged it off.

"I do believe that with a bit of proper training I would be able to train a bit more men to be able to see me. Maybe that would give me more control over them."I gave her a look that said I was sorry, but I was not. I was angry and needed to be better than this. I would not allow her to be hurt and I wasn't going to give up on her. I felt my magic crackling around me as the Floo went up, and I saw that the wizards were standing."What are you doing here?"

"What do we do with Hermione?"

"How do you know we have her in the house?"

"She's our wife."I opened my mouth and nodded, but I didn't have to think about it.

"We can talk, just like I do." I wanted to make my mental walls snap and I knew I couldn't.

"But we also have to be careful about their reactions. As much as she may be a little cruel about this one, I just can't imagine one of them having any qualms. It's just... it's not like they're all evil and all looking for a bit of revenge."

"That's... you think they're all evil?"

"No, they're all trying to put their own stamp on the world and make it more prejudiced?"Hermione nodded.

"Well, I'm not judging by any of their expressions, or their behavior, but they have to be careful. If they think they have the right to be here, they have to be even more careful."She couldn't go through with this. Not yet. What if they took a wrong turn and she was right? Could they come out of it with a vengeance?The second part of the plan worked perfectly. She wasn't sure how long she'd been waiting to go down on the last turn, but it was the perfect moment to come up with a new plan. She could be completely honest about everything that she knew. Pushing aside the depressing thoughts that perhaps she never really was what she thought she was, Hermione's instincts kicked in. Was she really ready to trust a wizard that horrible or would she trust her own eyes only in the dark? She was tempted to believe that she knew all of the secrets of her past, but that was only for a very short period of time. Each time she put her survival above all else, she would not hesitate to use her to her advantage. It was possible to survive a war that was a bloody, bloody mess. The Resistance had been brutal for years. All of the Resistance knew that. Yet, it was the knowledge that they were all in trouble.Draco could not help but joke to himself. He would take his little mistress and move to the war-zone. She didn't have to worry about a future with them. After all, they were both adults and had been through a lot. She was his for the first time. It was not like she was going to back down. She'd already given in to her husband's desires. She would never tell him anything that would make her feel any less than he already did. For all she knew, he had been working as a tracker himself since he was almost seven. She knew that he had been trying to track down and kill those who had been caught in the last war. Not only had they all been high-profile fugitives, but Fenrir had been so close to being a Death Eater once that he had been so close to becoming one himself. The Dark Lord knew that she was an asset to the regime. He would have no problem in finding her and finding the rest of the Resistance. It would be the S.S. as it was known. She would not allow herself to even think about the possibility that he was working for the Resistance. Protection for their family would be second to none.Hermione knew that he had some information that was important to her. He was a spy, one who had connections that she didn't give a damn about. If he was found to have betrayed her, she would be in even more danger than she already was. She wasn't sure her husband was up to something, but knowing what he knew and what he wanted, she knew that he would do what he could to keep his family safe. It was up to her to make sure he didn't do something he shouldn't. It was a dangerous gamble, but she didn't have an opinion on the man. He deserved to know what he had. He was just trying to stay out of the danger of his life. But, she also knew that he was a man with a lot on his plate. His lack of a good attitude was a lot on his plate. Hermione didn't have time to wonder what his problem was. The school could be a dangerous place. She could only imagine what she was going to do next.

The next morning, Hermione gathered enough courage to walk out of the front door of the Manor. When she made it back to her room, she found it empty. She turned on her side to look at the book on the bedside table. It was the book she'd been looking for.

In the middle of the night, Hermione sat on the bed for a full ten minutes. She laid down on her back and tried to ignore the memories of the last night.

"I'm sorry, Hermione, but I was scared. I didn't know what was happening. I couldn't feel the pain or the fear of my death. I was afraid that if I didn't see the little red nose in the mirror, I would never see it."

"I remember everything, even the last time I saw my reflection in the mirror. I was scared that if I didn't see it, I would never see it. I was so afraid that I wouldn't be able to see the little girl in the mirror and I would never see her again."

"I don't know what happened to you. You never spoke about myself. You seemed so distant, so distant-"

"- don't want that. I can't... no, I can't..." She squeezed her eyes shut as tears rolled down her cheeks.

"I want to be you. I can't take this... I can't look away from you. I... I would... want you... to-"

"-don't."

"Yes. You're right. I'm sorry. I don't want this. I'm sorry. I just can't." She rolled her eyes and reached into her satchel and pulled out her wand.

"I promise, I'll be able to use it to pull you away from me. I promise."She didn't hesitate to pull out her wand and continued to walk out of the house. The door opened and a house elf popped in and offered a small smile.

"Good to see you", she smiled back.

"Thank you, Hermione", she smiled and walked out of the room.

"Come on!", she said, walking in the hallway.

"Weâ€™ve been waiting for you here", she smiled again and walked out of the room. She walked into the room and sat down on the edge. She was wearing a black jumper with white lightning bolts around it. She looked around the room, watching the house elves, they were watching her. She walked to the small table and sat there, waiting for her elf to sit down. The table was empty and looked empty. She sat down feeling the heat rise to her skin."I think I am the only one left, right? Maybe I should open up with you." The table was empty. The room was dark, filled only with a darkness. Hermione opened her eyes, feeling cold thoughts and her heart was torn. Her eyes grew cold, she felt everything. She lay there, feeling all cold. A cold comfort and comfort from her soul. She was dead, her body and her magic going out of her and nothing she had ever held on to will. She had been by herself for ten years, her magic was all about her. She had nothing else but that comfort for her. But the things she held on to and felt so attached to felt cold. She closed her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest to muffle a whimper of pain that was impossible to decipher. She would have to take a chance and remove Voldemort's wand from her hand to access a Horcrux. There was no way she would be successful. Even if she didn't find a Horcrux, she would have to use the Death Eaters' wand to get her hands on one. When her eyes landed on the parchment, all she could think of was the horcrux. She picked it up and placed it in her hands. It was large, dark and ugly. She wasn't sure what it was about it that made the most sense, but it felt like a powerful possession. She was able to break free of the restraints of the restraints easily, even though she put a lot more effort into it than she thought. She was able to use her magic with great ease. Our daughter was just like her older sister. She was as safe in the wizard's arms as she was in the house of those who wanted her dead. Hermione didn't want to have any more questions than she needed to answer them. She had to figure out a way to keep her son safe. That was the one thing she wanted her son to have. She had to make it a priority, not just to her son. She couldn't afford to just let someone like Rodolphus live. She couldn't afford to just let him live in fear. She had to make it up to him, and she didn't think the wizard would like that either."Let him be, Hermione. Let him live." He stood and backed away from her, making her look at a rock before she could.

"I told you not to let him, and you threatened me, and I won't. I don't want him to do that."

"You'll do it, Granger." He kissed her, making her look away in fear.

"Let me show you how to survive. I promise."He stood and tried to step away, but she pushed him away.

"Don't take me as a challenge, please, just let me live." She kissed her temple and nodded before stepping out into the corridor. I just need to be outside before anyone finds me.I don't know how long I'm here and I'm worried about the next spell. Should I use Potions?

I don't want to make a scene. I don't have time to talk to Narcissa. I thought about what I did today and felt guilt wave my body back, but my mind was clear.

Harry is dead. The Dark Lord is dead. Ron and Hermione are dead. Both of them were in Azkaban. I don't know what I'm going to do next.

I don't want to do this without you. I think about the last thing I can do. I look around the room, trying to remember where I am. I hear a stab of pain as the door opens and I step inside. 

"How can I be sure that you are not being a spy?" Snape asks. 

"I know," he responds. 

I look around the room again, trying to remember where my bedroom is. He is looking at me in curiosity as if I am putting pressure on his heart. He tries to talk me out of this.

Why is he doing this? Why is he questioning me? Why is he making me do this?

I shut my eyes and start to walk towards the bed, I stumble against the wall and it takes me a few seconds to grab my wand.

"We need to get out of here, you know." I really need to get out of here, but my hand is not strong enough to hold the wand.

"We'll be safe, you know." I pull my hand away, look at the other wand in my pocket and it is not me, but my magic.

"We'll get out of here, you know." He nods, pulls my hand away, and I feel his magic in the back of my mind.

"We'll apparate, just need to get out of here before he starts making a scene." I blink his eyes and it takes a moment for his magic to return, but I don't have a second to stare at him.

"Are you sure you don want to hurt him? He's just a child!"Draco gave her an exasperated look.

"No, I don't think so. He's just a child!" That seemed like a very sensible response. He wasn't the only child. She nodded, but didn't say anything to him. He smiled, letting the tension in their bond dissipate.

"You're not a child!"

"No, I don't think so. I feel very secure in my own skin. I'm perfectly at peace with who I am, even when people have hurt me."

"I take it you're not a child?"

"No, Draco, I don't think so. I feel like I'm just a child."She nodded.

"I don't know what we are."

"I don't know how to feel about being here, Hermione. 'Mione, you're not the only one who feels this way."She sighed, as she closed her eyes.

"You're here because you felt safe. I'm not here because I thought I was safe. I'm not here because I was terrified. I didn't kill anyone."Hermione was in a rush. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but slowly she got to the truth. She wasn't sure who she would take next. Maybe Ginny or Ginny's mother would take her, but she couldn't decide who she would take next. She had to think.

It was late before dinner that night She was already in bed when her head lifted. The rest of the house went silent as Hermione opened her eyes. A shadow was sitting on a small dock in the yard. The shadows were pointed down at the table, saying something. Hermione thought she heard voices. They were saying something to her and she stopped to take a look. Her eyes flew down to her hand. She opened them slowly as she put her palm to her lips to feel the warmth. It was a light touch. She felt on her toes. She was so close. The shadows were slowly moving closer to her and then the shadows stopped. She felt on her feet. The shadows were slowly moving closer to her and then the shadows stopped.

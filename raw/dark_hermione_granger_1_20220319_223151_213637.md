"I see.

"But you don’t." Theo smiled, his red eyes flashing.

"I was only twelve. And I was the only one." Harry smiled.

"I like you," he said softly. He pulled his green eyes to his chest and smirked.

"I liked you, Theo." Theo pulled his hand back.

"Now that I have you all over again, I wanted to say something. It looked like the sun had just arrived for the day." Theo wrapped his other hand around Harry’s arm.

"You are beautiful, Harry." He said kissing his fingers.

"Hermione is beautiful, too next day they were going to a very special dinner for the seven and a half lions, but first they had to attend to the blood rituals. Harry was to take a lion, Hermione had to take a swine, and Theo had to take a chicken. Harry would ask what they were eating for the blood rituals, in the evening, the four of them would come back, and the lions would look at Harry and ask what he had eaten. The three of them would then begin the cutting. Harry would do the cutting and the chicken cut, then they would go out and buy a new dress for the feast, and Theo would wait for them. They would make their way to the dining room, and Theo would teach them what to do in the kitchen, so they could do their work in peace.

The next morning, Harry was able to finally get the letter. It was a message from the Head of the Department of Mysteries.

The Goblet of Fire was the only thing that could save a person from an impending death.

It was always Hermione's job to make sure everything was in place, but that didn't mean that everything was perfect.

The last thing Harry had planned was to send the letter to his godfather when someone got the chance, but he had to get the message to Harry himself.

He had had an idea that he couldn't keep his mouth shut.

He had a plan. plan that was perfect, but dangerous, but so-so. A plan that would keep the rest of the Resistance from hurting him.A plan that would make her happy.A plan that would make him a better father.A plan that would make him a better person.And a plan that would make him who Hermione wanted to be with.

Between the end of last night and the return of Draco and the peace of her soul, Hermione had decided that the time had come for her to return to the Malfoy Manor. She felt so alone. Like she was a prisoner in a dungeon that she didn't even know about.The Manor was her home, her home. And the moment she felt her eyes fill with tears, she shook her head, unable to give in.She’d imagined this past year as their home. And it was all connected, the house in flames and the flames in the air. The only thing that changed was the fact that Hermione had her own car, a car that she could drive. And it was an expensive one, the one that belonged to a man she didn’t know."You think that one will be your home?" Hermione whispered."Of course it will. I’ve been planning this house for years." Hermione nodded.

"It’s our home. And it’s the only home I allowed to keep as a residence of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black." Harry nodded his head.

"It’s safe, so the students have no reason to flee." Hermione said, pointing to the house where all the portraits resided.

"The only other place I know of that is my quarters here in the library, and I don’t want them moving in there." She shrugged.

"I’ll keep it that way." Harry nodded his agreement.

"What do you have to gain that way?" Draco asked, sounding unsure.

"Only gain that is worthy of us." Hermione said, knowing Harry’s answer. only thing that is worthy of us is the Queen’s Pleasure." Draco said in a low voice.

"That’s right. We’ll get it." Hermione said with a smile.

The Gryffindor girls rose from the couch and walked out of the dorms, leaving the Manor behind them. They turned around and walked out into the corridor.

"We couldn’t have done this without you." Pansy said as they walked forward and put their wands together.

"We wouldn’t have survived this without you." Blaise said.

"P Draco said angrily.

"I’m your father, and I’m Draco Malfoy." Draco looked into his eyes to let out a long, dark laugh.

"I’ve seen him in the library, and he’s a scoundrel." Draco said laughing.

"I’ve seen the two of you being very nice to each other, but I’ve seen you being quite mean to everyone." He said laughing.

"What on earth is wrong with you? You’re married to an idiot with half a brain and half a heart." Draco said laughing.

"I’m not even sure if I can say that’s a good thing." Lucius re-tried.

"You’re just saying it as a joke."

"Well," murmured Lucius, yet he was getting close to being drunk.

"Of course I am." He went back to his vault.

"We’ll go buy drinks today." Draco said grinning.

"You’re the one who got us into this mess?" Lucius asked carefully.

"I’m not sure you’re the one who got us into this mess." Lucius said smugly.

"Maybe you should send me some of the money," Lucius said gesturing for him to go through with his plan.

"As a last ditch effort to get a short-term hold on you, Lucius," the old man mumbled.

"But I’m sure you would be more content with the information I gave you."

"Only if you don’t give me anything else. You’ll need it." Fudge nodded his approval.

"You’ll have to give me some more money than that, my lord." Lucius said, looking truly anxious.

"And you’ll have to give me a lot of money too, my lord." Fudge nodded his agreement, and stepped forward, his black mouthed words spilling out."I’ll be the only one with the authority to make a statement," he clurred back, his voice dripping with venom.

"You are heirs to the Malfoy fortune. You are the one responsible for this mess. If there was a way for me to step forward, I’d have to do it."

"I don’t know how," Hermione mumbled.

"I’m not sure if I can. But I’m sure that you have some involvement."

"Alright," he said.

"Let’s see."He paused, watching the flash of silver and the deep, silvery rays of the sun’s rays. He knew that he’d need to focus on the next part. No matter how long it took, he would. He could keep up the illusion that he was able to.

It was dark outside, and the only light source he’d been able to see through a thick, thick lamppost was the moon. It was hard to see the surface, and it was small, almost nothing, but it was enough to know that it was dark. He’d been able to see through glass, though, for some reason. He was afraid that the idea of using magic to sneak out of a building wouldn’t be right for a pureblood, so he had to suck it up."Yeah, Parseltongue." Neville said, grinning at his friend."Yeah, I’m siding with you." Ron said.Ron looked up and said: "Well, you can’t be leaving."

"Oh, I’m siding with you." Neville said, shrugging."Yeah, but I’ll be honest, I’m not really sure what I’re doing." Neville said."Yeah, you’re right. You’re not like this." Harry said as they walked back. I’m okay with that, Harry." Hermione said as she sat down next to him."You have no idea how relieved I am to see you." Harry said as he gave a weak smile."I do." Hermione said as she sat down with Ron and Draco."I’ve been thinking of this for months. I’ve been thinking of you too." Ron said as he looked at Harry."Yeah, Ron. I know how to handle you." Harry said as he told Draco what he wanted to say."I can handle you." Ron said as he looked at Harry."I can handle you. I can handle you." Harry whispered."I’m not sure you’re willing to risk being your father... " Harry started."... Malfoy?" Hermione asked incredulously."I’m not sure yet. He’s not the sort to approach my friends in the middle of a group." Harry said with a smile.Hermione started to laugh."You know what?" She said in a low voice."Well, I’m not sure. I’m not sure if I’d be willing to risk it. I’ll see what I can do."

" know, I’m sure it’s not your best idea," Hermione said.

"Just trust me."

"I’ll do as you say, Hermione. I’ll kill everyone who doesn’t look like him, and I’ll break their necks."

"That’s what I’ve said before," she said eagerly.

"You’re right. If we’re going to hurt people, we have to hurt everyone else. We’re going to hurt each other."Hermione watched her aunt die. Her aunt was the most beautiful woman in a world full of death-eaters, but one that was also hated by her. She was a type of monster who would've made a fine Queen if she were alive to do so. Her only purpose was to bring misery and misery to those who were not in misery. She would never apologize for her crimes, but she would try to make her way back to her old ways and be happy. She would always be grateful for the kindness and kindnessness that was bestowed on her. From the moment she entered Hogwarts she would be happy.It was highly likely that the witches and wizards of the village would be at least somewhat surprised to learn that the man had been responsible for the murder of a child. An intruder would have no fear at all. The fear of death would be the only guarantee that she would have. She knew that she was hardly the most logical of Death Eaters. If she was able to survive beyond that, she would. But, she also knew that she wouldn't be able to survive long enough to heal her damaged body. In order to be able to survive long enough to kill herself, she would have to tread water.

She knew she was odd, that she was in hiding, but she didn't have the courage to go outside. The temperature outside was gradually dew off, but the heat inside grew even more unbearable. She was both tired and dehydrated. A small comfort was that she didn't feel like she had to resort to magic. Her mind was all she could think of. It was too different from the way her parents used to live. When was the last time they used magic? Was it different this time?She was tempted to ask the wizard how he was doing, but he wouldn't tell her how she was doing. He was a healer, after all. His magic was almost entirely gone, for lack of a better term. She didn't want to even think about running again. Besides, she wasn't sure what to do next. They wouldn't be able to live without the influence she'd cultivated. She would need to take drastic measures to ensure it wasn't a repeat of the second visit. Her mind was running wild from the first. A smile would be the best way to describe it. She'd seen it all before. For a long time, she thought that Voldemort would have chosen her as his pet.

The Weasel guided Hermione to the edge of the bed and tucked her in. The sensation of being pulled towards her was almost too much for her. She was too deep, too sensitive. Her skin was turning red, her eyes were open and ready to meet her captor's cold stare. He was smart as always, and it was good to see that.

"I think my little pet needs a bit of a punishment for hurting you."

"I'd like that."

"I know, I'm not that bad." Hermione chuckled, and felt a pang in her heart for the poor creature "Just what do we do next?"

"I don't know. We can't do anything, I mean, I'm really scared that he will try to harm me again. But I would hate to do it again, especially with all of his power and influence in Hogwarts."Severus drawled, "You can't be trusted with that power in this situation. I can't tell you what I think of Potions. I don't want to be disrespectful."

"Well, not to be disrespectful, but I want to advise you."

"I am the one who advised him." She said, pursing her lips.

"I think he was under the influence of the Imperius."Severus closed his eyes, "Severus I am the last of the Triumvirate. I am the student, and the Philosopher's Stone. But will you be teaching at Hogwarts next year?"

"Of course, students of Hogwarts need a headmaster," Bellatrix replied, and the entire house nodded in unison.

"I am currently the Headmaster of Potions. I am the Potions Professor, and I am the one who taught Hagrid the Mandrakes. I am also the Potions Professor, though I shall be teaching a second year."

"What are you talking about?" Severus asked. He looked around though and was amazed at the Potions Professor's mind.

"I was wondering if you could teach Potions?"

"Yes, I was. I wanted to see how you're handling it." He smiled at her, then kissed her.

"I think you'll be a great teacher, Hermione."

"I know, and I'm glad you're willing to help me." She taunted, knowing that she would most likely be the teacher.

"I'll teach you how to apparate."

"Thank you, Granger. I can't believe you would want to teach." Draco replied, his eyes boring into her as her attention was focused on his next words."If I get the chance, I will. I want to see you graduate from Potions first." She smiled and opened her arms, turning back to face him. She had to admit that he had probably been right.Draco turned to her and smiled, the last of his smile gone.

"I’m going to go get it," he said, his eyes meeting hers."What do you need?" she said, eyeing the new vehicle before sliding it in front of her and pulling out a small box.

"It’s going to look really nice."

"I’ll take it," he said, and she turned to accept the box.Theo nodded eagerly.

"Sure."Hermione opened the box to reveal a small divider she carried with a small strap on.

"Can we talk about it?" she asked Draco.

"I wanted to ask about Draco relationship with Hermione."He shrugged.

"We’ve spent a lot of time together under the influence of the Dark Lord. He’s the one with the most influence." He frowned."And I’ve noticed that his relationship with Hermione is improving."Hermione gasped, both in shock and amusement.

"I wonder if that’s something he doesn’t know about."Draco nodded.

"Well, I suppose I can see the change."

"It’s not that simple," she responded.

"I’m sure it’s possible."

"My dear, there an even more compelling reason why you should want to learn about potions. I’m sure it’s only the sort of thing you’ll find in a library."Hermione clutched her hands in the back of her hair, feeling herself sway as the door swung open. The sound of a bottle being dropped onto the floor transformed into a series of bottles bubbling away in an apparent explosion of liquids every which way. She turned back to the table and looked at the cauldron. It was nearly time, and she knew exactly why. The bubbles were like unknown gas, but the whole thing was a mystery. She’d never even thought of testing it on herself.

Hermione felt her mind slipping away from her thoughts. The thought of Draco watching her again gave her the courage she needed to continue. The fact that he was so close to her in his arms and still in the same place gave her the strength she hadn't felt in a while. She could only hope that if he was able to see her again that he would be able to see her as a person. He was Hermione's friend and a promise that she had made to him. She couldn't let that affect her the way the world had.The last thing she wanted to do was make a scene. If it was the end of the year, she would never be able to come out of the shadows. She needed to get out of the house. Maybe she could even sneak out of it. He was right. She would be safe. She would be good to go back to the man she'd been cursed to share in his misery. 

 Ashley sighed in relief when she placed her hand on the tip of Tom's wand. It was a simple incantation that she knew would do the trick. She was able to conjure an empty room with an old bathroom. The door was locked and she could sneak in if she wanted to. She was in no rush to leave the home. No matter how far her wand traveled, she would never be able to reach the backdoor. Only a day or two she would be able to get inside. Tom would have to make sure she was there before he interrogated her. Unfortunately the Cruciatus Curse had its own set of reactions, and Hermione was well aware. She didn't have a lot of time to get her wand out of her waistband. Though she was in the middle of the room, she wasn't paranoid enough to risk it. She had more time than that. The lecture was in order.Hermione was in no position to help her. The tension was already growing. The tension was growing and the edges of the wards were starting to crumble. The situation was becoming so dire that it was difficult to watch. She had to be calm about the unknown. She was afraid to be left in the dark. She didn't know how to tell the wizard what to do. When the curse came to him, he was shocked; he had never seen a man so reckless and violent as to fall into such misery. The curses were multiplied and multiplied until they were like the sun, shining brightly and becoming a constant in all of Wizarding Britain. He watched the man, who had been lying on the floor, turn pale and pale and pale until his eyes grew dry and he had to stop. He watched the man's limp body descend into a series of blue and green flames. He watched the man's eyes, which were now more of a dark brown, turn dark gray, and he put his head on the side of the stool. He watched the man's eyes, which had been turned dark gray, turn bright, bright green. When the light from the fireplace faded, a small silver button fell off the side of the car and slid off the outside of it, revealing the place where the bomb would be located. Of course there would be no bombs in this village, and it was likely they would have some, perhaps even a few, already planted. No wonder the Dursleys knew this place was their hideout even if they knew nothing about it. It was an obvious mistake to leave the bombs here, not to mention how many of them they left behind, they didn't have the weapons. The Order would find something, and they would find a way to get it. 

 The sun was out the window, illuminating the village, and it took all of two minutes to find Harry's hiding place, over a kilometer from the village. 

 "Amelia, where are you?" Harry cried, startled. 

 "I’m in the kitchen," Amelia said, looking up.

"I can help you." 

 "Yes," Harry nodded. 

 "Well, I’m supposed to help you and Ron," Amelia said gently.

"But where are you?" 

 "I’m not sure," Harry said. 

 "I’m sorry, but it’s too dangerous," Amelia said soothingly. @ "Let’s get out of here now and get out of here!"

"But you’re in my house, right?" Amelia asked skeptically.

"I’ve been woken up in the middle of the night." She shook her head.

"You don’t have to do that."

"You don’t have to do that?" Amelia arched an eyebrow.

"But I didn’t get you there in the middle of the night. I was woken up just before midnight." She groaned.

"You didn’t get a chance to wake me up like that. I think I will be fine after all."

"What? How? What time is it?"

"I’m not sure. I think it’s a few hours ago."

"Don’t be ridiculous." She voiced.

"I’ll go get you some tea."She followed that up with trying to stop Draco. It was a wonder he didn’t hex her. It was one thing to go through the pain of torture and the screams of his, but he’d never do anything to her. It was just a fantasy. He’d have to do it in order to get the food he needs in his next class." 

 "I know you! I’ve been wanting to do this for years, but I’ve finally had the chance to get a slice of this!" 

 This was a gift from Dumbledore, but I didn’t know whether I’d receive it 

 It had four pieces of china, parchment, ink, and a blurb in a large hand-written hand- by Dumbledore. 

 I grabbed the floo powder and a bottle of water. 

 "I’ve been thinking of giving this to you for a second." 

 I looked at the note and realized I didn’t want the boys to feel that way."Everyone shut their curtains and allow us to get to the Prophet," Ron said.

"The whole school’s in recess."Harry’s eyes went wide at that.

"What? Where are they? What can I do for them?"

"I’m sorry, Ron, but I’m not sure what I’m going to do. I’m not sure what we’re going to do." Ron shut the curtains and grabbed a small vial from the drawer.

"It’s not something we can get."Harry nodded helplessly, looking at a small vial on the table."We’ll do it." Draco said as he slid it into Harry’s hand and poured a cleansing liquid."How? Why?" Harry asked in horror."Because we are all blood-traitors." Blaise said smugly as he placed the vial in the middle of the table."We’ll never let it go that far." Harry said as he took a bite of the food."Why?" Harry asked in shock, the food tasted bitter and the smell made his skin crawl."Because we are all pure and pure-bloods." Blaise said grandly, feeling the burning heat of his eyes.

"He’s my brother and he’s my green." Theo said with a slight chuckle.

"He’s the first one to be told he’s half-bloods." Harry said grinning triumphantly."I’m the first," Blaise said laughing.

"I’m the youngest one," Theo added, grinning.

"You’ll know that by now." Harry said, grinning.

"You’ll be the youngest in three generations." Harry said happily.

"I was one of the youngest boys when we were first drawn to Hogwarts." Bl grinned.

"He was my first love." Draco sat down next to him and kissed his head.

"I want to be one of them, he wants me to be a spy for him. I know that." He said, waving Hermione’s hair to him.

"I’m going to be so proud to be called that," he said smiling.

"I didn’t want to be a spy for my father, I wanted to be a friend." He leaned back and kissed her hand.

"I love you, Draco." Hermione and Draco shared a small smile and held hands.

"I love you too, Blaise. He kissed her hand and kissed her lips.

"I’m sorry," she said softly.

"I’m so sorry." She looked at him.

"I’m sorry for all the pain I caused you, for thinking that I’d hurt you like this."Without another word, she left. 

 Hermione had just gotten off the train when she heard a noise. It was a car approaching, and she turned to see the silhouette of a woman in what appeared to be a room. She turned to look at the woman, but before she could even open her mouth, a tear escaped. It was the voice of Narcissa Malfoy.She stood up clutching her wand in hand, and conjured a wand to her hair and put it into her hands. Her curls were pulled back into a thin, dark purple ribbon that wrapped around the cut on her forehead. Her dark curls were in the shape of the Draco Malfoy.A wandless and silent wandless cast. It isn't working.The Darkness was slowly coming back, finally, and it felt like the wind was blowing. 

 "Is this what you thought you wanted?" Hermione asked in a low, inhuman voice. 

 My family was a lie. It is possible that they aren't truly human. 

 "A lie? What do you mean by that?" 

 "I'm sorry, Hermione. But I need to go." She stopped the door from being able to lift itself open. 

 "Are you sure you want to go with me?" Draco asked. 

 "I'm not sure that I want to go, but I can't leave my room without you." She said, dropping the mirror and carrying her bag down the stairs."What? No, I'm going." She said, looking at the house.

"I'm going to take care of my sister-in-law." 

 "Don't be ridiculous, Hermione. You're going to have to be a bit more careful." Draco said, looking at the house. 

 "Draco, I'm not leaving! I want to go to the Manor. I need my son back! I can't do this to a child! I'm being watched!"

"I watched you at the Manor."

"I know, but I wouldn't want to miss a day of your life." Hermione's face fell as she grabbed Draco's hand.

"You can't keep this up, and I love you so much, Hermione!"Draco's eyes were wide with emotion as he held Hermione's hand out for Hermione.

"I won't do it again, and I promise you I won't do it again. I'm sorry I got caught."

"What's the matter, Draco? What happened? You're so wrapped up in your past that you don't know how to tell the difference."

"I was a Death-E a mudblood, and then a Death-Eater after becoming the Dark Lord. I'm not sure I know how to tell the difference."Her jaw dropped as she tried to think of the first thing she'd say to Antonin. He was being ridiculous. What was he even saying? "I was a mudblood. I was raised as a Lord. I was the only one at Hogwarts who wasn't very Dark. I have blood that's... not the same as Muggle." She knew what he was implying, but it was a valid one.

"My mother was a Muggle. My father was a Muggle." There was a smirk creeping across his features.

"You're saying that?"

"She was a widow," Severus said.

"She didn't have a choice, and ... "

"No," the other scoffed.

"She didn't have a choice. She was a good woman. I'm not sure she could be a good mother."

"You know," the young man told him.

"If she had wanted to choose a child, she would have done so by now. But she chose a child. She wanted to be a mother. She chose a son."The Potion Master took a deep breath.

"Is that what you mean by 'she'?"

"Yes," the other nodded.

"She wanted to choose a child. She wanted a child to be a mother. She chose a son. I mean, I was told that, but I didn't. I'm not sure how far you've fallen. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to fall." 

 He stopped, his eyes slowly opening, fear taking over.

"You're not about to tell me that we should have stayed in bed. I'm not sure how much longer we can stay with you and your husband, but I've got to. I can't bear another minute alone in our house without a fight. We've got to. I will do everything in my power to make sure that they stay out of the other's way, and I will." 

 "I will make sure that you stay out of either of our boys' parties. That they don't get into any trouble. I mean, it's different, I was having trouble sleeping last night, and she went ballistic on me. I was so over it, I couldn't sleep. After she went down on me, she grabbed my wrists and released me from her. She was tight, she was a really tight girl, and I don't want you to get yourself killed."

"I don't want to kill anyone. Besides, she's my friend, and I do. I didn't know what kind of friend you were, and I don't want that. Besides, killing someone is not something that we can just randomly choose to fuck. Besides, I'm a Death Eater, and I have to keep my feelings to her."

"You are a Death Eater, you know." She studied him.

"I know that. I'm not sure what to even say to that."

"Because you'd rather kill Fenrir than believe that I killed you."

"No, you won't believe that either, Hermione. We're so close, and I don't want to risk my own feelings. It just doesn't make any sense."

"I'm an arsehole, but that's not really true. You're a Gryffindor, and I am my Hogwarts brother, so you know you're not the only one." She wiggled her eyebrows.

"I would follow you around if you were in danger. I'll kill you if you were in danger.I thought that you would be interested. I wanted to see how the Death Eaters were handling the situation."

"What do you care for, Malfoy? You care more about the children, aren't you?" Narcissa's eyes were pleading with him for his life as they saw a smile tug at his lips.

"Don't you think I'm just being a little paranoid, Hermione?"

"No idea, love. I'm sorry, I just don't know what you're talking about." Narcissa tried to explain that there was no way she would be able to tell him what she really wanted.

"You're the one that wants to know. The Order is afraid of you."

"The Order? The Death Eaters are afraid of you?"

"The Death Eaters are also known as the Death Eaters The next time you meet one, make sure you don’t die."

"Yes, you won’t. I’m sorry. I’ll be sure to tell the Dark Lord if he tries."Hermione was really glad he would be telling the Dark Lord that she’d tried to get his help. It was a promise that she didn’t want him to make. It was about the life of his nephew, and she’d done her homework with him. She didn’t want to have to deal with the man who tried to kill her and then still couldn’t find any answers.

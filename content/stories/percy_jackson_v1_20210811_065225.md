Later that night, we got into bed and fell into a rare, dreamless sleep. 

“How are you?” Hermione asked in confusion. 

I shrugged it off as not knowing what I was going to say for the next three hours or so until Harry woke 
up at four o'clock on October one morning. We were both asleep when Ron came running towards us from his 
room trying desperately hard to make sure he didn't fall over by accident. 

The rest of the girls seemed confused. Not even five minutes later they found out who Nico di Angelo really 
had been hiding away somewhere. He looked like an old man with long grey hair floating down his back. 
His dark glasses perched high on top him made his eyes look more menacing than usual and there werenned two 
large bags under his nose holding something called 'Gift cards'.

One contained charmspeak written in Greek meaning "What's this? How could she know?"

Everyone stared at each other shocked except Leo and Clarisse who just shook their heads. Jason explained 
everything happening after Percy left because people started asking questions about how Persephone would 
get rid of him if Will did anything else drastic without her help...

Maybe all those Demigods still knew where Hades lived! 

But none ever questioned whether Annabeth would be able handle being part god during the war... 

After dinner everybody went upstairs hoping no Umbridge girl showed up again since nobody liked Cho Chang 
much anymore. Instead, everyone watched outside looking at the huge empty house that was already on their way.             

“I have to go back so I can help Harry- oh... whatever is going up will be fine?" 

"And what about you guys?! You are all here for me!"

"We need your family and friends together too much! Please don't let this happen again; 
anyone else would kill us if we did it without our parents or others knowing how terrible things were in America 
since they weren't the ones who saved my mom from being murdered by a muggle god but now she has to suffer 
through more than just PTSD of her childhoods."

"Mr. di Angelo, he should apologize immediately before turning around when no one asked him why– 
but keep his mouth shut until Hogwarts gets permission," Hermione whispered with worry 
etched into her voice like someone had been stabbed.                                       

Then Cho came along beside them running towards Umbridge talking directly after Marvus saying something 
odd asking Pansy "Will everything be alright?" 

## ***

Houses could use normal names instead of strange yet highly charged symbols depending on the context.
Some people had forgotten they were actually Latin, which meant that it was a sign of their ancestry, 
while others simply knew how to pronounce it properly. There wasn't much else in the world besides 
letters and numbers; there wouldn’t be anything useful for them except spelling books or homework.

Professor Dumbledore began by introducing his new class, called "Quidditch Quaffle". The tournament 
itself would have been a real adventure because its participants only needed one 
person to win: Harry Potter himself from the beginning.

"Well done, Mr Weasley," said Professor Dumbledore with an airy smile at the students as they gathered 
around him throughout lunchtime each day.

"Congratulations, Harry!" said Ron proudly, getting everyone together. 

"I hope we all enjoyed this game today."

"Yes, sir?" said Hermione quickly after he finished eating breakfast without question before she spoke 
up again once more about her brother's accomplishments in Quirrell-making alone last night when he 
went missing suddenly. She shook her head angrily but nevertheless gave him a knowing look and 
winked back fondly towards Nico who came out from under those covers.

"Ron, I just got off my broom yesterday...the Slytherin team beat Hufflepuff-"

"You know what? You better tell me your name first..."

"Oh no!" cried Percy coldly laughing hard even though he did not remember having any spells casted against me, 
so I don’t know what that means. However if you ask why Voldemort is trying to kill Harry, he has a point. 

Hermione took his hands and nodded.

"He's in the library!" Draco said with a raised eyebrow at him from behind Ron.

"Then go find him."

"I'll be right back," Hermione said as they got up after changing into their Hogwarts robes.

"Thank Merlin for this trip! It..." she said, hugging his shoulder 

"You two are going to have a blast fighting off this crazy guy tonight?"

"What about us?" Nico asked worriedly looking around them. The three demigods looked at each other.

"No way we can leave without anyone noticing who your friends are doing business with here. We need 
someone else to watch over our stuff while we work on getting some information out of them." 

A second later Luna showed herself just like before but she was wearing matching blue jeans which 
made everything look weird. Annabeth had already brought along an old book saying something 
called 'On Heroes' although no one seemed surprised by it. They all turned towards Percy and 
Leo talking to Neville who gave them an apologetic look.

They wandered down the corridor where Sirius Black was hiding inside the castle, leaving only Ginny.

"Where did he get those eyes?" Fred demanded coming forward. 

"Sirius has been helping Professor McGonagall during class every day since September-"

"Yeah? Why do you think does Miss Granger like to see her ?" 

Rhode shrugged, "The wizarding community seems pretty confident in the fact that she's a witch." 

She smiled at them and continued on with their conversation before following Harry out of the Great Hall for 
breakfast later as they got ready once more.

"Hello everyone! Welcome back to my first week here at Hogwarts! I am going over some things we have learned 
so far about ourselves this year: Firstly that Voldemort is back; it was only yesterday he claimed me by force and taken Dumbledore down from power. 
We are still fighting him but not nearly enough to stop him yet!"

"Secondly, we can't keep telling lies during wars anymore ever because our enemies will know what we are up against."

"Now then why don’t we go talk to Professor McGonagall now if that helps us understand how both sides react when facing each other ?"

"She might be right though..."

"I suppose...but-" The demigod began but his voice faltered momentarily. She rolled her eyes again however quickly, trying hard all around- 

"It doesn't mean no one knows which side has been most successful tonight."

After an encouraging nod to Ron and Annabeth who were talking, Rhode returned to her seat just watching Max walk 
away while waiting for either Lupin or Draco Malfoy helping her through any lingering questions left unanswered.

“You’ve got a good feeling I have to tell you something Harry ?” 

Nico sighed and he looked at his friends nervously before answering. 

"It would be nice if it was in my blood. It makes me feel better when I see people who are so much more than that as well"

“I think we should get out of here now! We need to find our way back home once the other schools start 
getting ready for tomorrow" Harry said walking towards them all with worry on her face. 

She stopped herself from smiling but she quickly opened her mouth to say anything else without letting go where they were going. 
Her friend took off running after him even though Nico didn't notice because there was nothing stopping what happened between 
Malfoy Manor and Hogwarts itself.

"Harry Potter told us last night," She whispered quietly giving Nico some space beside her. 

"He suggested Voldemort's son come first."

"Yes?" asked Nico. His brown eyes glowed brightly despite the dark aura surrounding them both. He nodded thoughtfully agreeing with 
Hazel and Piper about putting Harry's name forward later this evening.
